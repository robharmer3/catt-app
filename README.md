# My React Native App

## Cat App

## Description

This is a simple React Native app.
It allows users to see cute pictures of random cat breads along with the bread name and a short description.

The tech that I have used for this application is:

- React Native
- Axios
- CSS
- HTML
- Node.js
- Expo

## How to use it?

To run the app locally, please follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run "npm install"
3. Run "npx expo start"

It can be view on a wb browser or by using the Expo Go app.
Please see here for detail about the Expo Go app: https://expo.dev/
